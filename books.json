With updated material from noteworthy hackers such as Bill Gates, Mark Zukerberg, Richard Stallman, and Steve Wozniak,  Hackers  is a fascinating story that begins in early computer research labs and leads to the first home computers.    Levy profiles the imaginative brainiacs who found clever and unorthodox solutions to computer engineering problems. They had a shared sense of values, known as \"the hacker ethic,\" that still thrives today.  Hackers  captures a seminal period in recent history when underground activities blazed a trail for today's digital world, from MIT students finagling access to clunky computer-card machines to the DIY culture that spawned the Altair and the Apple II.  \n \n    Amazon.com Exclusive: The Rant Heard Round the World    \n  By Steven Levy  \n \n                 Author Steven Levy         When I began researching  Hacker s--so many years ago that it’s scary--I thought I’d largely be chronicling the foibles of a sociologically weird cohort who escaped normal human interaction by retreating to the sterile confines of computers labs. Instead, I discovered a fascinating, funny cohort who wound up transforming human interaction, spreading a culture that affects our views about everything from politics to entertainment to business. The stories of those amazing people and what they did is the backbone of  Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution . \n \n But when I revisited the book recently to prepare the 25th Anniversary Edition of my first book, it was clear that I had luckily stumbled on the origin of a computer (and Internet) related controversy that still permeates the digital discussion. Throughout the book I write about something I called The Hacker Ethic, my interpretation of several principles implicitly shared by true hackers, no matter whether they were among the early pioneers from MIT’s Tech Model Railroad Club (the Mesopotamia of hacker culture), the hardware hackers of Silicon Valley’s Homebrew Computer Club (who invented the PC industry), or the slick kid programmers of commercial game software. One of those principles was “Information Should Be Free.” This wasn’t a justification of stealing, but an expression of the yearning to know more so one could hack more. The programs that early MIT hackers wrote for big computers were stored on paper tapes. The hackers would keep the tapes in a drawer by the computer so anyone could run the program, change it, and then cut a new tape for the next person to improve. The idea of ownership was alien. \n\n This idea came under stress with the advent of personal computers. The Homebrew Club was made of fanatic engineers, along with a few social activists who were thrilled at the democratic possibilities of PCs. The first home computer they could get their hands on was 1975’s Altair, which came in a kit that required a fairly hairy assembly process. (Its inventor was Ed Roberts, an underappreciated pioneer who died earlier this year.) No software came with it. So it was a big deal when 19-year-old Harvard undergrad Bill Gates and his partner Paul Allen wrote a BASIC computer language for it. The Homebrew people were delighted with Altair BASIC, but unhappy that Gates and Allen charged real money for it. Some Homebrew people felt that their need for it outweighed their ability to pay. And after one of them got hold of a “borrowed” tape with the program, he showed up at a meeting with a box of copies (because it is so easy to make perfect copies in the digital age), and proceeded to distribute them to anyone who wanted one, gratis. \n\n This didn’t sit well with Bill Gates, who wrote what was to become a famous “Letter to Hobbyists,” basically accusing them of stealing his property. It was the computer-age equivalent to Luther posting the Ninety-Five Theses on the Castle Church. Gate’s complaints would reverberate well into the Internet age, and variations on the controversy persist. Years later, when another undergrad named Shawn Fanning wrote a program called Napster that kicked off massive piracy of song files over the Internet, we saw a bloodier replay of the flap. Today, issues of cost, copying and control still rage--note Viacom’s continuing lawsuit against YouTube and Google. And in my own business—journalism--availability of free news is threatening more traditional, expensive new-gathering. Related issues that also spring from controversies in  Hackers  are debates over the “walled gardens” of Facebook and Apple’s iPad. \n\n I ended the original  Hackers  with a portrait of Richard Stallman, an MIT hacker dedicated to the principle of free software. I recently revisited him while gathering new material for the 25th Anniversary Edition of  Hackers , he was more hard core than ever. He even eschewed the Open Source movement for being insufficiently noncommercial. \n\n When I spoke to Gates for the update, I asked him about his 1976 letter and the subsequent intellectual property wars. “Don’t call it war,” he said. “Thank God we have an incentive system. Striking the right balance of how this should work, you know, there's going to be tons of exploration.” Then he applied the controversy to my own situation as a journalism. “Things are in a crazy way for music and movies and books,” he said. “Maybe magazine writers will still get paid 20 years from now. Who knows? Maybe you'll have to cut hair during the day and just write articles at night.” \n\n So Amazon.com readers, it’s up to you. Those who have not read  Hackers, , have fun and be amazed at the tales of those who changed the world and had a hell of time doing it. Those who have previously read and loved  Hackers , replace your beat-up copies, or the ones you loaned out and never got back, with this beautiful 25th Anniversary Edition from O’Reilly with new material about my subsequent visits with Gates, Stallman, and younger hacker figures like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. If you don’t I may have to buy a scissors--and the next bad haircut could be yours!

Who are these people, what motivates them, and why should you care?    Consider these facts: Everything around us is turning into computers. Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer. Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon your TV will. Your car was not only designed on computers, but has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in 1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store are being replaced by the Internet.     Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age , by Paul Graham, explains this world and the motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers on an unflinching exploration into what he calls \"an intellectual Wild West.\"    The ideas discussed in this book will have a powerful and lasting impact on how we think, how we work, how we develop technology, and how we live. Topics include the importance of beauty in software design, how to make wealth, heresy and free speech, the programming language renaissance, the open-source movement, digital design, internet startups, and more."},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Framework for Analysis and Case Study","pubdate":"","image":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s24659676.jpg","binding":"","images":{"small":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/spic\/s24659676.jpg","large":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/lpic\/s24659676.jpg","medium":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s24659676.jpg"},"alt":"http:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/20579878\/","id":"20579878","title":"Malicious Hackers","author_intro":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","price":"","translator":[],"pages":"224","publisher":"Biblioscholar","isbn10":"1249600731","isbn13":"9781249600732","alt_title":"","url":"http:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/20579878","author":["Kleen, Laura J."],"summary":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","pubdate":"","image":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/pics\/book-default-medium.gif","binding":"","images":{"small":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/pics\/book-default-small.gif","large":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/pics\/book-default-large.gif","medium":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/pics\/book-default-medium.gif"},"alt":"http:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/19812004\/","id":"19812004","title":"Seguridad Digital y Hackers \/ Digital Security And Hackers","author_intro":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","price":"","translator":[],"pages":"","publisher":"","isbn10":"8441517827","isbn13":"9788441517820","alt_title":"","url":"http:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/19812004","author":["Gallardo, Juan Diego Gutierrez"],"summary":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","pubdate":"","image":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s20802495.jpg","binding":"","images":{"small":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/spic\/s20802495.jpg","large":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/lpic\/s20802495.jpg","medium":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s20802495.jpg"},"alt":"http:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/17565993\/","id":"17565993","title":"Mind Hackers","author_intro":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","price":"","translator":[],"pages":"","publisher":"","isbn10":"1468188763","isbn13":"9781468188769","alt_title":"","url":"http:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/17565993","author":["Snider, Sharon"],"summary":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","pubdate":"","image":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/pics\/book-default-medium.gif","binding":"","images":{"small":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/pics\/book-default-small.gif","large":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/pics\/book-default-large.gif","medium":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/pics\/book-default-medium.gif"},"alt":"http:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/11555795\/","id":"11555795","title":"Faerie Hackers","author_intro":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","price":"","translator":[],"pages":"","publisher":"","isbn10":"2070313212","isbn13":"9782070313211","alt_title":"","url":"http:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/11555795","author":["Heliot, Johan"],"summary":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","pubdate":"2011-4-29","image":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s6644225.jpg","binding":"Paperback","images":{"small":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/spic\/s6644225.jpg","large":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/lpic\/s6644225.jpg","medium":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s6644225.jpg"},"alt":"http:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6714063\/","id":"6714063","title":"LUXURY HACKERS","author_intro":"DANILO VENTURI IS A GLOBAL CONSULTANT FOR FASHION AND LUXURY COMPANIES.

Prevalence of these security breaches is increasing the interest in specifically how hackers work and what can be done to stop their destructive ways. Most people look at hacking as black magic, not really understanding how it is accomplished. But--if security analysts don't understand hacking--they can't protect against it. This book goes step-by-step through hacking, breaking down specific exploits, explaining how they work, what to look for, how to run them, and how to protect a site against them. Hackers Beware starts with a roadmap of the various areas of hacking but quickly delves into the details of how specific attacks work and how to protect against them. Since most attacks we hear about either occur or are perceived to come from hackers, people are very interested in \"how they do that\", the techniques hackers use to break into systems. Hackers Beware is unique in that it gives specific exploits, exactly how they work and how to protect against them. This book will help readers understand what security threats they are up against and what they need to do to protect against them."},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","pubdate":"","image":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s4386648.jpg","binding":"","images":{"small":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/spic\/s4386648.jpg","large":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/lpic\/s4386648.jpg","medium":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s4386648.jpg"},"alt":"http:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4671017\/","id":"4671017","title":"Profiling Hackers","author_intro":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","price":"401.00元","translator":[],"pages":"279","publisher":"","isbn10":"1420086936","isbn13":"9781420086935","alt_title":"","url":"http:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4671017","author":["Chiesa, Raoul\/ Ciappi, Silvio"],"summary":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","pubdate":"2005-06-30","image":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s3904857.jpg","binding":"Paperback","images":{"small":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/spic\/s3904857.jpg","large":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/lpic\/s3904857.jpg","medium":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s3904857.jpg"},"alt":"http:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3887775\/","id":"3887775","title":"Hacking con Google\/ Hacking with Google (Hackers Y Seguridad \/ Hackers and Security) (Spanish Edition)","author_intro":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","price":"USD 61.95","translator":[],"pages":"","publisher":"Anaya Multimedia","isbn10":"8441518513","isbn13":"9788441518513","alt_title":"","url":"http:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3887775","author":["Johnny Long"],"summary":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":42,"average":"7.7","min":0},"subtitle":"","pubdate":"2012-2-22","image":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s22705757.jpg","binding":"Paperback","images":{"small":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/spic\/s22705757.jpg","large":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/lpic\/s22705757.jpg","medium":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s22705757.jpg"},"alt":"http:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7906768\/","id":"7906768","title":"Machine Learning for Hackers","author_intro":"","tags":[{"count":328,"name":"机器学习","title":"机器学习"},{"count":88,"name":"O'Reilly","title":"O'Reilly"},{"count":78,"name":"R","title":"R"},{"count":75,"name":"计算机","title":"计算机"},{"count":41,"name":"machine","title":"machine"},{"count":38,"name":"社会网络分析","title":"社会网络分析"},{"count":37,"name":"learning","title":"learning"},{"count":37,"name":"Programming","title":"Programming"}],"origin_title":"","price":"GBP 30.99","translator":[],"pages":"324","publisher":"O'Reilly Media","isbn10":"1449303714","isbn13":"9781449303716","alt_title":"","url":"http:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7906768","author":["Drew Conway","John Myles White"],"summary":"Now that storage and collection technologies are cheaper and more precise, methods for extracting relevant information from large datasets is within the reach any experienced programmer willing to crunch data.
